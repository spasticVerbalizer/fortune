fortune: Display random quotes
==============================

## Introduction

`fortune` is yet another implementation of the Unix-style `fortune` program
that displays a random message from a database of quotations. Conceptually,
it's similar to the BSD fortune program originally written by [Ken Arnold][].
Unlike Arnold's program, this version is written in [Python][] and should
run anywhere there's a Python interpreter.

This version has been updated to work on both Python 2 and 3.

For installation and usage instructions, please see the [web page][].
